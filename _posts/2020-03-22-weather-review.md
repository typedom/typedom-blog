This post was written for an old version of the blog. It may look a bit odd.

Sunny. About 30 degrees in Western Sydney. Zero rain all day and a slight chance of a light shower in the evening. A barely there westerly wind is meant to give way to a cooler southerly later in the afternoon. Some whispy cirrus clouds make the sky seem just that much more higher than usual.

The weather is a bit of a dream today. It’s that kind of ideal weather that makes you want to be outside doing stuff. The kind of weather that you mow the lawn in. The kind that makes that run actually seem fun. The kind that you have barbecues in, that couples take lazy walks through the park in together, that kids bike around the neighborhood or run amok in playgrounds in. It’s the kind of weather that distracts you from the Monday to come. It’s the kind of weather that almost makes you forget that the world is ending.

I started the day braving a trip to the supermarket. It wasn’t quite the post-apocalyptic scenes I was expecting. The shelves were mainly stocked apart from the few notable exceptions of chicken meat and toilet paper. We didn’t need any toilet paper because my dad had been diligent enough to buy a pack or two throughout the week as shipments arrived, but it does raise the question, how much toilet paper is a reasonable amount to have? I don’t know anymore.

Afterward, we spent the day cleaning the house. My dad decided to apply liberal amounts of disinfectant to most of the kitchen and dining surfaces, leaving a scent of cleaning lavender which never really smells like real lavender. I made an Iced Americano and stepped outside for a bit.

I was never a fan of non-sweetened iced coffee until I went to Japan. To me iced coffee was more about Starbucks Frappucinos or the kind you get at cafes with a scoop of ice cream that’s meant to melt and sweeten the drink. So getting an Iced Americano for the first time one rainy morning in a McDonalds at Hatagaya Station was a bit of a revelation to me, and now I don’t know how I ever lived without it. There’s a kind of simplicity to it: Coffee shot, water, ice. A simple drink for complicated times.

There was a bumblebee in the garden going about his business, flying about, sticking his head into my dad’s roses. Maybe the world isn’t exactly ending after all. But if it was, today wouldn’t be a bad day to end on.
