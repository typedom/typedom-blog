Cloudy with a max of 20. Humid. It's the kind of weather that's just in between. The kind of weather where you look out the window every so often wondering if it's going to rain, but it hasn't yet. The kind of weather where you're not sure if you want to go out because it might rain, but at the same time, it might not. So you sit waiting for something to happen. Anything. And it doesn't.

I'm on holidays from now until the New Year. Usually this kind of extended break would be full of plans and meetups but with the recent COVID outbreak, like the weather, plans are all but uncertain. I'm meant to go out for lunch tomorrow, but I'm not certain that will go ahead. I probably won't know until tomorrow. So instead, here I am, making a new blog again.
